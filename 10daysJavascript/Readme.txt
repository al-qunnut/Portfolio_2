Here's a roadmap to help me get there, along with how i can take action at every step:

---

### 🚧 1. **Solidify the Core Concepts**
Even with basic knowledge, revisiting core topics can cement your foundation.
- **What to Learn**: Functions, scopes, closures, callbacks, ES6+ features (let/const, arrow functions, spread/rest, destructuring).
- **How**: 
  - Rebuild small projects using modern syntax.
  - Try coding without looking at reference material.

---

### 🧠 2. **Understand Advanced JavaScript**
Time to dive into the brainy stuff!
- **What to Learn**: 
  - Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, `async/await`)
  - Event loop and call stack
  - Object-oriented vs functional programming
  - Prototypes and inheritance
- **How**: 
  - Watch deep-dive YouTube tutorials (e.g., MPJ’s FunFunFunction or Fireship).
  - Read MDN documentation and articles from blogs like freeCodeCamp or CSS-Tricks.

---

### ⚙️ 3. **Work with the Browser & DOM**
A big part of JavaScript happens in the browser.
- **What to Learn**: 
  - DOM manipulation and events
  - Fetch API, forms, storage (localStorage, sessionStorage)
- **How**: 
  - Build interactive web apps: to-do lists, calculators, weather dashboards.
  - Use DevTools to debug and inspect.

---

### 📦 4. **Explore JavaScript Ecosystem**
Go beyond plain JavaScript.
- **What to Learn**:
  - Modules (ES modules, CommonJS)
  - Package managers (npm/yarn)
  - Bundlers (Webpack, Vite)
- **How**: 
  - Start a Node.js project from scratch and publish something on GitHub.
  - Read other people’s code and refactor it.

---

### 🧪 5. **Testing & Debugging**
Know how to break—and fix—your code!
- **What to Learn**: Unit testing (Jest), debugging patterns.
- **How**: 
  - Write test cases for functions you’ve already built.
  - Set breakpoints and trace execution in Chrome DevTools.

---

### 🚀 6. **Projects + Real Practice**
There’s no learning without doing.
- Build projects like:
  - A real-time chat app (using Firebase)
  - A portfolio website (hosted on Netlify or GitHub Pages)
  - A quiz game with scoring and localStorage
