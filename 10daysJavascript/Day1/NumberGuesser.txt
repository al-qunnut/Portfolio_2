Perfect—kicking things off with the **Number Guesser** is a great move! Here's a simple, beginner-friendly roadmap to structure your project from scratch, while still applying core JavaScript concepts like variables, functions, conditionals, and event handling.

### 🛠️ Number Guesser Game – Code Roadmap

#### 1. **Set Up Your HTML Structure**
Basic elements:
- Input field for the user to type a number
- Button to submit their guess
- A section to display results or messages
- (Optional) A reset button to play again

#### 2. **Define Game Variables in JS**
- Random number between 1 and 100 (use `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`)
- Number of attempts (if you want to limit guesses)
- DOM references to update UI with messages and inputs

#### 3. **Handle User Input**
- Add an event listener to the "Submit" button
- Read the value from the input field
- Compare the guessed number with the target number

#### 4. **Give Feedback to the Player**
Use `if...else` to check:
- Is it too high?
- Too low?
- Correct?

Then, update the result/message element in the DOM with an appropriate message.

#### 5. **End Game & Reset Option**
- If the guess is correct or attempts run out, disable input
- Show a “Play Again” or “Reset” button to start over
- Reset the game state and UI when clicked

### 🧪 Concepts You’ll Practice
- `Math.random()`
- `querySelector` / `addEventListener`
- Variables & conditionals
- UI feedback with `textContent` or `innerHTML`
- Functions to organize logic (e.g. `checkGuess()` and `resetGame()`)
